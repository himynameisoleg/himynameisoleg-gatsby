      <p>🪛 <strong>Hardware Tinkerer:</strong></p>
      <p>When I am not writing code I love nothing more than diving into projects that involve building, repairing, and tinkering with various types of hardware. Whether it's using my <a href="https://www.creality.com/products/ender-3-3d-printer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">3D printer</a> to create custom parts and prototypes, working with Arduino and Raspberry Pi to build and program electronic devices, repairing vintage CRT TVs and PVMs to play high fidelity retro games, or building analog guitar pedals from scratch, I am constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a hardware enthusiast. Whether I'm working on a small, personal project or collaborating with others on a larger scale, I am always eager to take on new challenges and explore the limitless possibilities of hardware.</p>
